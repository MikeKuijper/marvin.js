# What exactly is Marvin.js?
Marvin.js is a fully open-source JavaScript neural network library. You can use it to create neural network implementations with ease!

# What is a neural network?
A neural network aims to achieve Artificial Intelligence (AI) by creating a network of _neurons_. Now, what does that mean? Basically, a neural network is an imaginary network of layers of _neurons_, nothing more than an object whose value is dependent on other neurons in the previous layer. It then continues to do some crazy math that doesn't suit this simple explanation to determine its value. Once it's done that, it moves on to the next layer and repeats the process.
## Note:
1. The first layer is called the input layer. The last is called the output layer.
2. The input layer is set to the input at the start of the feed.
3. The output layer is (surprise, surprise) the layer that gets outputted.
4. Training a network means adjusting the crazy math in order to make the output more like the desired.
5. The cost of network is a value to reflect how wrong a network is _on average_.
